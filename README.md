A serverless **backend** application to track job applications, notify about pending jobs older than 3 days, and automatically clean up old records. Built with **AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway, SNS, and Terraform**.

## Features
- Add jobs via an HTTP API (POST `/jobs`).
- Jobs are stored in DynamoDB with `createdAt` timestamp and TTL `(7 days)`.
- Scheduled notifications for jobs older than 3 days and has no status update.
- CSV / pretty table notifications sent via SNS email.
- CloudWatch logging for debugging and monitoring.
- Infrastructure-as-code deployment via Terraform except for the SNS.

## Setup

1) Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd Secure-Job-Application-Tracker
```

2) Install Terraform and configure AWS CLI credentials

Modify main.tf if needed:
DynamoDB table name
Lambda environment variables
SNS topic ARN

3) Package Lambda functions as ZIP

```bash
cd lambdas/add_job
zip -r ../../lambda_add_job.zip .
```
```
cd ../notify_jobs
zip -r ../../lambda_notify_jobs.zip .
```

4) Deploy the config from main.tf as infrastructure

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

5) Subscribe an email to the SNS topic for notifications.

## Usage

- Add a Job via API

```bash
curl -X POST <API_GATEWAY_URL>/jobs \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "JobID": "xxx",
    "Title": "Backend Engineer",
    "Company": "xxx",
    "createdAt": <epoch time>
}'
```

## Notifications

- Notify Jobs Lambda runs automatically (EventBridge)
- Sends CSV in table format via email with jobs older than 3 days. You can followup on the job status accordingly.

## Security Layers in the Architecture

1) DynamoDB is never exposed directly to the internet. All reads/writes happen only via Lambda functions. This prevents any SQL injection or direct query attacks since thereâ€™s no endpoint for attackers to hit.
2) DynamoDB encrypts all data at rest (AES-256) by default.
3) Gateway & SNS use HTTPS (TLS 1.2/1.3) for all communication.
